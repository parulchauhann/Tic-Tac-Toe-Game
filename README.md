# Project Overview: TIC TAC TOE

We're excited to present this popular and nostalgic game of Tic Tac Toe which has been played by almost everyone atleast once in their childhood. This game is being played on a paper for decades but here we have tried to make this game more eye catching and interesting with the help of some special  background  theme and sound effects which will entice to play this game again and again.

# Game description:

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player paper-and-pencil game. 

It's played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" in an empty cell. 

The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your marks. 

It's a game of strategy and planning to outwit your opponent and achieve a winning combination before they do.
